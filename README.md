# Corewar

Corewar is one of the interesting projects in our 1337 curriculum, where we had the opportunity to write an emulation `VM` of the computer components. The RAM, Process, Threads, scheduling, and other interesting subjects were just one side of this team project. the other ones were a visualizer of the state of our VM and an `ASUMBLER` program that compiles assembly files to binary ones, and these last ones we can run in our VM and visualize them.

# Motivation
  In this Project we were a team of 4 students, that got a totally new topic with very little guidance, but a lot of motivation to explore this new topic.

  And that what happed, during the preparation, the coding, and the debugging we've learned how computers work at the low level, the magic of processes, threads, and CPU segments.

  these are all now just a part of our DNA now ðŸ˜‰

2. `git clone https://github.com/mohamedLazyBob/corewar.git`
3. `make all`
4. `./corewar ./resources/players/Asombra.cor ./resources/players/Norman.cor`
    <br>the program accepts 1 ... 4 programs, and can be runed with different options. I'll leave it to you to discover them.
